"""
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given three 32-bit integers x, y, and b, return x if b is 1 and y if b is 0, using only mathematical or bit operations. You can assume b can only be 1 or 0.
"""


def which_num(b, x, y):
    pass


print(which_num(1, 5, 8))
print(which_num(0, 3, 4))
